;;
;; Easily use and navigate multiple shell buffers, including remote shells.
;; Fundamentally, multishell is the function `multishell-pop-to-shell' -
;; a la `pop-to-buffer' - plus a keybinding. Together, they enable you to:
;;
;; * Get to the input point from wherever you are in a shell buffer,
;; * ... or to one of your shell buffers if you're not currently in one,
;; * ... with just a keystroke.
;; * Use universal arguments to launch and choose among alternate shell buffers,
;; * ... and select which is default.
;; * Append a path to a new shell name to launch a shell in that directory,
;; * ... and use a path with Emacs tramp syntax to launch a remote shell.
;;
;;       For example: 
;;
;;       * '/ssh:example.net:/' for a shell buffer in / on
;;         example.net; the buffer will be named "*example.net*".
;;
;;       * '#ex/ssh:example.net|sudo:root@example.net:/etc' for a root shell
;;         starting in /etc on example.net named "*#ex*".
;;
;; (NOTE that you can try to use, eg, '/ssh:example.net:' to get to your
;; home dir on example.net (if you had one), but that sometimes fails -
;; particularly remote+sudo to homedir - on an obscure bug. Until that's
;; fixed, you may need to start remote+sudo shells with an explicit path,
;; then cd to the homedir.)
;;
;; Customize-group `multishell' to select and activate a keybinding and set
;; various behaviors. Customize-group `savehist' to preserve buffer
;; names/paths across emacs sessions.
;;
;; See the `multishell-pop-to-shell' docstring for details.
;;
;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2016-01-16 1.0.5 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - Fix - recognize and respect tramp path syntax to start in home dir
;;   - Offer to user to remove shell's history entry when buffer is killed
;;   - Fix - prevent duplicate entries for same name but different paths
;;   - Simplify history var name, migrate existing history from old name if any
;; 2016-01-06 Ken Manheimer - Released
;; 2016-01-02 Ken Manheimer - working on this in public, but not yet released.
;;
;;; TODO:
;;
;; * Isolate frequent failure with remote tramp home-dir syntax (`/host.dom:')
;; * Track the current directory in each buffer's history entry.
;; * Provide toggle to see completions buffer with just buffer names or + paths

(defun multishell-pop-to-shell (&optional arg)
  "Easily navigate to and within multiple shell buffers, local and remote.

Use universal arguments to launch and choose between alternate
shell buffers and to select which is default.  Append a path to
a new shell name to launch a shell in that directory, and use
Emacs tramp syntax to launch a remote shell.

Customize-group `multishell' to set up a key binding and tweak behaviors.

==== Basic operation:

 - If the current buffer is shell-mode (or shell-mode derived)
   buffer then focus is moved to the process input point.

   \(You can use a universal argument go to a different shell
   buffer when already in a buffer that has a process - see
   below.)

 - If not in a shell buffer (or with universal argument), go to a
   window that is already showing the (a) shell buffer, if any.

   In this case, the cursor is left in its prior position in the
   shell buffer. Repeating the command will then go to the
   process input point, per the first item in this list.

   We respect `pop-up-windows', so you can adjust it to set the
   other-buffer/same-buffer behavior.

 - Otherwise, start a new shell buffer, using the current
   directory as the working directory.

If a buffer with the resulting name exists and its shell process
was disconnected or otherwise stopped, it's resumed.

===== Universal arg to start and select between named shell buffers:

You can name alternate shell buffers to create or return to using
single or doubled universal arguments:

 - With a single universal argument, prompt for the buffer name
   to use (without the asterisks that shell mode will put around
   the name), defaulting to 'shell'.

   Completion is available.

   This combination makes it easy to start and switch between
   multiple shell buffers.

 - A double universal argument will prompt for the name *and* set
   the default to that name, so the target shell becomes the
   primary.

===== Select starting directory and remote host:

The shell buffer name you give to the prompt for a universal arg
can include an appended path. That will be used for the startup
directory. You can use tramp remote syntax to specify a remote
shell. If there is an element after a final '/', that's used for
the buffer name. Otherwise, the host, domain, or path is used.

For example:

* Use '/ssh:example.net:/home/myaccount' for a shell buffer in
  /home/myaccount on example.net; the buffer will be named
  \"*example.net*\". 
* '\#ex/ssh:example.net|sudo:root@example.net:/etc' for a root
  shell in /etc on example.net named \"*#ex*\".

\(NOTE that you can specify a remote homedir using tramp syntax,
eg '/ssh:example.net:'. However that sometimes fails on an
obscure bug - particularly for remote+sudo with homedir
syntax. Until fixed, you may need to start remote+sudo shells
with an explicit path, then cd to the homedir.)

You can change the startup path for a shell buffer by editing it
at the completion prompt. The new path will be preserved in
history but will not take effect for an already-running shell.

To remove a shell buffer's history entry, kill the buffer and
affirm removal of the entry when prompted.

===== Activate savehist to persisting your shell buffer names and paths:

To have emacs maintain your history of shell buffer names and paths, 
customize the savehist group to activate savehist."
